# The Slomak keymap for kbd67

This layout works as the US Colemak layout, but can access Slovenian accented characters on the secondary layer. This is done by changing the location of some keycodes, and manipulating the shifted states of a few others. The templates for these switching functions are taken from: https://github.com/brianoverby/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/spacebarracecar

The keyboard has some other special features:

- Split spacebar: function in the middle, enter on the right.
- Fn key activates the second layer when held, and spotlight (cmd + space) when tapped.
- Space Cadet functionality, implemented with switching functions, not the default QMK one
- Two media keys in the upper right corner.
